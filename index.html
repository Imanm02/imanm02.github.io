          <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a final-year Computer Engineering student at Sharif University of Technology.
            My main research interests are Human-Computer Interaction, Large Language Models, and Privacy-Security.
            I have volunteered as a Research Assistant at Duke University, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and the University of Salerno, working on projects like decentralized social media platforms and improving Large Language Models.
            I am passionate about designing AI systems that enhance human-AI collaboration and help people improve their skills.

            <h4>Interdisciplinary Security, Privacy, and Interaction Research Lab (InSPIre Lab)</h4>
            <h5>April 2023 - Now</h5>
            <h6>Research Assistant | Duke University, Supervisor: Dr. <b>Pardis Emami-Naeini</b></h6>
            <ul>
              <li>We've conducted a novel HCI research study focused on the perceptions of social media security and privacy among users in Iran. This involved the selection of 22 participants diverse in age, gender, and technological expertise, all residing within the country.</li>
              <li>I played a pivotal role in designing the study and orchestrating semi-structured interviews, which unearthed a general limited understanding of security and privacy concerns among the users, particularly with domestic social media platforms.</li>
              <li>I also authored the research paper, synthesizing interview data to highlight the dichotomy between trust in non-domestic versus domestic social media platforms, despite users' limited knowledge of the underlying security and privacy features.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>I contributed to a novel approach and developed code for information retrieval from academic documents and papers using Large Language Models (LLMs). Also, we created a customized dataset to evaluate model performance, culminating in the acceptance of our paper at CHI2024 Workshop on LLMs as Research Tools.</li>
            </ul>

            <h6>Research Intern | Chinese University of Hong Kong, Supervisor: Prof. <b>Qiang Xu</b></h6>
            <ul>
              <li>We engaged in groundbreaking research aimed at enhancing the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) utilizing a one-shot learning method.</li>
              <li>I developed and programmed a novel approach by training multiple LLMs on distinct data subsets, then integrating their outputs through a weighted averaging technique to reinforce model resilience.</li>
              <li>I also executed comprehensive testing on various datasets, and implemented each aspect of the model's coding, significantly contributing to the project's experimental framework.</li>

              <li>We've worked on two Computer Vision and HCI Education-based papers. The first has been accepted in the LBW track of CHI 2024 conference, while the second has been accepted as a full-paper at CSCW 2024. At the core of our research lie the principles of HCI, Education, and AI. Our latest project involves the creation of an AI-powered fashion recommendation system designed to simplify the process of selecting gifts.</li>
              <li>I implemented a Blockchain-based education website, using Django for Backend API, React for Frontend design and Docker.</li>
